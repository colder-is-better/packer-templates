# Packer template for openSUSE machine images
A Packer template (configuration file) for VirtualBox, VMware Fusion, and QEMU machine images. All VMs run openSUSE Leap 42.3 which, thanks to AutoYaST, is automatically installed during build time. This Packer template (`leap423srv.json`) is based on [42.3-x86.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openSUSE/vagrant/master/definitions/42.3-x86_64.json), from the [openSUSE / Vagrant](https://github.com/openSUSE/vagrant) repository. Included is also a simple shell provisioner (`leap423srv.prov.sh`). The script is called by Packer immediately after the installation of the guest OS. Its job is to remove the standard offline repository added by the installed, add four new online repositories (OSS, Non-OSS, OSS Updates, and Non-OSS Updates), and then bring the whole system up-to-date.

This repository has been created because of this [extensive presentation and HOWTO of Packer](https://deltahacker.gr/?p=17969), for [deltaHacker magazine](https://deltahacker.gr) (text in Greek, active subscription may be required).
